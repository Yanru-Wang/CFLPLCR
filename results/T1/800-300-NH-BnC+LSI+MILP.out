Set parameter TimeLimit to value 7200
Setting B&C+LSI': The proposed B&C algorithm based on formulation (40) (equipped with the lifted submodular inequalities), where the lifted submodular inequalities are computed by using the MILP based approach that solves the MILP reformulations (E.2) of the lifting problems (43)
